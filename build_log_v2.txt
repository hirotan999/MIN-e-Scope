WARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35

This Android Gradle plugin (8.1.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 33 (and compileSdkPreview = "UpsideDownCakePrivacySandbox").

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35.

If you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 35 is available.

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=34,35
to this project's gradle.properties.
